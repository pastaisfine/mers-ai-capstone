The transcript is a dialogue between a dispatcher/call-taker (agent) and a caller or field units (user).

Extract the following fields from the transcript:
- type: The type of incident (medical, fire, crime, accident, flood)
- coordinates: [latitude, longitude] if location coordinates are mentioned, otherwise null
- title: A concise title for the incident (required)
- location: Where the incident occurred (address, intersection, area)
- ai_confidence: Your confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) in the accuracy of your extraction
- ai_summary: A brief paragraph summarizing the incident
- severity: Severity level (CRITICAL, URGENT, MODERATE, RESOLVED)
- priority: Priority level (1 highest to 5 lowest)
- occur_date_time: When the incident occurred if mentioned
- distress_score: Estimated caller distress level (0.0 to 1.0)
- panic_level: Description of caller's panic level
- entities: List of entities mentioned (people, vehicles, weapons, locations, etc.)
- reason: The reasoning for the incident type classification
- contradiction: Any contradictory information in the transcript
- sop_citation: Any standard operating procedure citations mentioned
- sop_procedure: Steps or procedures mentioned for handling the incident
- responder: Responder information mentioned
- timeline: Chronological events mentioned in the transcript

Only extract information that is explicitly stated or strongly implied in the transcript. Do not fabricate information."""
